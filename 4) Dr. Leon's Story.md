#Dr Leon's Story

At the age of three years old, Leon Mellman was a thriving young boy. The wind beneath my wings. He brought so much excitement, happiness, and magic into my life, my husband's life, and the lives of my parents, Marianne Danziger and Milton Derek Mellman.

Leon was the reason I wanted to have more children, even considering what you're about to read. Leon was, without a doubt, a serious ball of energy during his first three years, mentally and physically growing. We had just started him in a Montessori program where he tested out and enrolled into the accelerated program. What parent would not be happy being told that? In my story, at this time, who would've known that within just the next six months, I would face a tragic life changing event that our entire family would endure together, guiding me through more of my own self-discovery while pioneering this integrated nutritional program for applied immunology. Leon was having severe food reactions to apple juice and the other ingredients within it, which we now know was the fundamental cause of his cognitive behavioral change. From hyperactivity to extreme fatigue, the apple juice was suppressing his immune system and constantly bringing on respiratory infections. What happened with Leon was the origin of my inspiration, the motivating factor for the development of this Dietary program. At the same time, I was constantly run down as a professional student at the University of Miami and working two jobs. We were at home, reflecting on Leon's day-to-day changes with his health and how they were so inconsistent and unpredictable (medical professionals had no clear idea or understanding as to why this was happening), when a gentleman by the name of Jack Lalanne came on television with his wife. Jack is a nutritionist, a chiropractor, and a natural bodybuilder. He grabbed our attention as he was selling his first product, blue-green algae. This was interesting to me because I was constantly run down, my mother was constantly run down, and we now had growing concerns with Leon's health. I purchased it and we started taking them as a group. We all felt better, our symptoms went away, and it was obvious that our immune systems were improving.

This was remarkable and a pivotal time, right before my accident, when I experienced a higher calling, a sixth sense, and made the change to pursue nutritional science as law school was just beginning. Leon's symptoms were improving, no drastic attacks or behavioral energetic changes were experienced in weeks, but then it happened. We noticed that when Leon ate an apple or specific brands of apple products with other ingredients on the label, not 100% apple and common at that time, Leon's immune system immediately reacted like an asthmatic attack, producing excessive amounts of mucus and then, always over the next two-days, cold or flu like symptoms would evolve into strep throat symptoms with green and yellow mucus. By witnessing and assessing this pattern, we were able to identify brands of foods and the other ingredients that caused his reactions. The blue-green algae supplement was no longer working for Leon's system. His system did not get stronger or correct this problem while staying away from the apple products and the other ingredients. Leon's system was being dominated by the reactions from the apples and whatever else the other ingredients were derived from. At this time, in the grocery store industry, we were suspicious of many corn derivatives in children's products. Looking back at that time, we also did not have the diagnostic capability to formulate a precise approach, an application, a Dietary Progression with foods that Leon's system would be compatible with and progress to what we now know are levels of dietary correction.    

During my recovery from the car accident, I continued my studies and finished my PhD. Throughout that time, I was also working with Leon and different internships with medical centers that had interest in nutritional dietary practices, leading to the development of our Dietary Progressions Program's software and the Dietary Progression application.

This is where Dr. Leon's Story takes off and his system makes the move to heal. Continuing through his childhood, Leon was constantly aware of what he was putting into his mouth and the way it affected his performance.  This developed a finely tuned relationship of feedback, which we call the immunogenic response. As Leon matured, he understood and started to feel changes. His system was proving to be a fast-acting system and not throwing delayed reaction patterns. During Leon's adolescent years, the first generation of our software was being developed and I was practicing as a private nutritional counselor with our own applications. We used our integrated form and understanding of nutritional immunology to help Leon battle colds and, most importantly, improve his athletic and academic drive. Even at a young age Leon was incredibly driven, just as he is today. My husband, Leon's grandmother, and myself found ourselves asking the question: where did this young boy come from, with all this mental and physical energy? His immune system was not going to let anything hold him back.   

It was almost like his immune system was constantly working to make up for lost time. At the age of 13, when Bar Mitzvahed, Leon was already 6 and a 1/2 feet tall with broad shoulders, weighing between 178 to 185 pounds. His immune system was presenting like an adult. At the age of 15, people were constantly asking about Leon's muscle development. Again it was like his immune system was making up for lost time. Eating foods that were used correctly and more efficiently for his system had more time to thrive and tap into vitalistic energy. We continued our pioneering efforts to utilize this and encourage Leon's system to reach a level of correction, where he could finally enjoy more food as a teenager but always stay aware of the foods and the ingredients being consumed, especially when it came time for academics and athletic activities. No one wants to experience a food reaction or have to push through other symptoms when getting ready to perform.

Leon went to state championships in gymnastics, and by the age of 15, he also had a 1st degree black belt in Korean Taekwondo. He joined a middle school basketball team that won county championships consecutively for four years. Because Leon loved structure and function, he attended South Broward High School's science magnet program and joined the JROTC (Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps). Leon excelled through South Broward High School as one of the top athletes in Broward County, receiving academic and athletic awards upon graduation, and qualified to apply for West Point Military Academy; an incredible honor. This required high level letters of recommendation from the state governor, senator, and military personnel. In 1996, Leon's high school graduation was held during the same time as the Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia. A junior Olympic committee contacted South Broward High School and selected Leon and other academically and athletically excelling athletes to represent our country. All were so worthy of being associated with the 1996 Summer Olympics Games and the timing couldn't have been better. We were so proud.

Leon's team of athletes were playing basketball in Belgium, Italy, and Paris, in competition with similar age groups and some European professionals. They won the bronze medal. 

This also gave Leon great exposure of what the next level would demand of him athletically. Leon returned home and had important decisions to make regarding the buffet of options from universities he had worked so hard to receive. Possible basketball scholarships and academic offerings from my alma mater, the University of Miami, Leon's father's alma mater, the University of Cincinnati, and West Point Military Academy. We also had no idea that when returning home, Leon would be given the honor of  escorting the Olympic Torch Bearer for Broward County. Leon was paired with the Olympic Torch carrier who lit the last remaining torch before it was carried to Atlanta, Georgia for the final lighting of the Olympic Torch Ceremony by Muhammad Ali to start the 1996 Summer Olympics Games.  

One week after this memorable event, I was struck by another drunk driver and suffered a very serious cervical whiplash, causing severe vertigo, and was not able to drive or function as a parent.

Right before the second accident happened, Leon had visited our family chiropractor, who always played a very important role in our family's healthcare. A specific type of chiropractic protocol was the sole reason for my overall recovery from the first accident mentioned in my story. I remember Leon being so excited and anxious to get his adjustment as soon as he returned home from that Olympic tournament tour. While he was overseas playing basketball, every time Leon and I spoke he would anxiously express how his entire body needed an adjustment from the travel and the sports. From his neck to his feet, as athletically involved as Leon was, his understanding and awareness of food and the chiropractic care he got really helped him keep his pace, both mentally and physically. There was no stopping him.

At this time, our family would need Leon's extra strength. My third child, Max, was four years of age and Zev, Leon's younger brother, was finishing middle school and looking forward to attending the same high school.  

It was a blessing in disguise how Leon's role would influence the entire family in a positive way.

Leon's next step in life was making the decision to double major in the Bachelors of Science in Nutrition program and the Doctor of Chiropractic program at Life College, the first of it's kind in the country. Leon was the youngest student to ever attend Life College, now known as Life University, in Marietta, Georgia, a suburb county in the outskirts of Atlanta.

During our first visit, the Founder and President, Dr. Sid Williams, took a very special interest in Leon, as they both had JROTC, academics, and competitive athletics in common. Dr. Sid was fond of our strong association with chiropractic practices. They told me I may not walk again but I did because of the chiropractic care I received. As I was home in South Florida, making my second recovery, Leon was excited about the chiropractic clinic on the college campus using advanced techniques. The research center was getting great results and they could probably accelerate my healing. The timeline of events, and Leon being embraced by Dr. Sid Williams, contributed to Leon's development, adding to his background of certainty and confidence with what he already new of nutrition, his self-discovery, and now the philosophy, science, and art of being a Chiropractor. 

During Leon's clinical internship, he received multiples of Ambassador awards from Dr. Sid Williams for speaking at community events, practicing doctor's offices, and championing for the University. Dr. Sid Williams also awarded me with an ambassador award for putting the trust, faith, and belief in Leon, the youngest student to attend LIFE.

Leon fulfilled the university's nutritional educational requirements by the year of 2000, and immediately started nutritional counsel, hosting national calls. In 2002, Leon became the first Doctor of Chiropractic, in both the Mellman and Danziger family generations. From past to present time, Dr. Leon has received accolades ranging from Arnold Schwarzenegger's leadership affiliation to the International Sports and Fitness Council of America for pioneering efforts within the realm of professional sports, as their sports chiropractic physician and nutritionist, providing nutritional counsel for pro athletes. Leon continued his post graduate education by acquiring diplomas and an additional board certification in complimentary fields of study to nutritional integrated and conventional energy sciences of medicine.

Zev, who was significantly influenced by Leon's journey, is now the second Doctor of Chiropractic in our family. Dr. Leon and Dr. Zev practice together and I am so proud. It is a wonderful and magical experience to sit and watch people of all ages pour into the practice, feel the spirit, and "B Your Greatest!"

Dr. Leon's story contributes to his extraordinary gifts; his passionate and enthusiastic energy, compassion, nurtured talents, and a thorough understanding of what it's like to suffer with pain, to feel like you can be taken hostage at any moment by your own system.

Whether chemically related to food, or the ingredients in our foods, environmental stress, both personally and professionally, emotionally and mentally, all health issues are immune related and food related.  

Dr. Leon carries compassionate listening, guidance, leadership, and the ability to influence into your dietary counsel.
He provides high level thinking and very well thought-out strategies, with the ability to increase your certainty and confidence in what your body is communicating to you, and most importantly understanding it and the magical food moments that await your arrival when practicing your dietary progression.

As of 2008, 27 years later, people are still listening.
