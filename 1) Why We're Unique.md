#Why Our Program Is Unique

Weight loss, weight maintenance, and health benefits are the most popular reasons for using this program. If a person is not at their appropriate weight for their frame size, they will lose weight on a daily basis until their system reaches the correct weight. If they are at the correct weight, they will automatically maintain this weight. If someone needs to gain weight, it will occur because it is what that system needs to be healthy. This is the effect of knowing and eating the right foods for your particular system. We use Olympic standards to determine your weight per frame size and give instruction on how to determine this by measurement during your medical interview call. 

During the interview, Dr Leon will give you approximations of the target weight per frame size specific to your medical history within the confidential healthcare information discussed in counsel. These details and your blood sample are integrated when diagnostically formulating your Dietary Progressions program.

Health benefits are another result of being on this dietary program. Some people can lose weight on most programs but they still need their medications because all health problems are not weight related. 
All health problems are immune related. This is another reason I developed the application dietary progressions, which is the program that connects the diagnostic foundation we formulate for you. 

For example, what we experienced with my first son Leon, which he is now the physician for this program, Dr Leon Mellman. Or when a new clients main focus is to reduce medication(s) or have positive changes on labs yet their weight per frame size is good, or they simply wish to improve performance at work & at play. 

**All health problems are immune related.**

Our program has something to offer, even if your main focus is not weight related. When it’s the correct food for your system, this equals the right energy for your system.

The wrong foods equal (=) the wrong energy. 

##Welcome To Dietary Progressions™!

There have been myths and theories about rotational diets, so to be very clear - this is not a rotational diet.

With our integrated nutritional program, Dietary Progressions™, it is not necessary to remove a food item forever and it is not necessary to rotate foods in pursuit of reaching "a form of correction or compatibility" with food structures.

The Dietary Progressions Program initiates with a blood sample, your specimen specifically. It enables us to learn and identify if a client has any problems with Food structures. There have been only six known mechanisms identified in immunology within the past sixty years that are believed responsible for improper recognition of food structures eaten.

Within my first nineteen years, I discovered that there are many more "Unknown Mechanisms" than known and have developed the protocol / application to manipulate and adjust them, progressing towards forms of correction. 

During those nineteen years (plus a few more) I documented all the Unknown Mechanisms that presented themselves with the Known mechanisms.  This very Unknown territory lead me to pioneer our very own "Dietary diagnostic formulation"  software.  With the use of our integrated dietary software and our protocol / application, the Dietary Progression Program, your system is able to correct and repair itself in a short period of time resulting in improved health, performance, and weight loss because foods are utilized correctly.

If there are some foods, chemicals, preservatives, or additives that are causing an inflammatory response, indicated by inflammatory reactions, or symptoms within your system, (gas, bloating, sinus problems, different forms of reflux, your weight going up on the scale), your educational call series, which many topics are mentioned throughout the website, followed up by your format reviews with a list of other parameters that we review during your initial orientation call, **Titled, How To Play the Game**™ guiding you through 4-months of counsel.

Having an interactive experience with your system will aid in understanding what your system is going to communicate to you from the correct foods being eaten. Starting right in your mouth, digestive neurological highways of communication are shared between your nervous system and your entire digestive system.

Connecting our "Dietary diagnostic software" and the application Dietary Progressions provides your **Dietary Playbook**™, a guide for your system to evolve with these unknown mechanisms & known mechanisms. During your Dietary Progression, if there are any other foods that we are exposed to eating, conventional, GMO, NoN-GMO, Raw, BioDynamic, Organic or a combination of these, were not identifiable by preliminary laboratory processing and then our dietary diagnostic software formulation by Dr. Leon Mellman. By starting on your program, this will reveal in time the other Unknowns that may be causing problems, including your body holding weight or contributing to ill health.  

It's the integration of your dietary progression that connects the diagnostic foundation we formulated for you.

Your system can have the opportunity to correct and repair itself. As every system is different, some achieve correction in a short period of time but for others it's over a longer period of time. The parameters of establishing what defines correction, or what determines your own correction, will be initially discussed during your medical interview and again during your orientation call, **Titled, How To Play The Game**™.  

This when your **Dietary Playbook**™ is presented to you by Dr. Leon Mellman, for your initial understanding of the diagnostic materials within, as it directly relates to your immune system.  Your **Dietary Playbook**™ arrives with a very accurate scale that offers specific features Dr. Leon will provide during your 4 months of counsel, implementing and interpreting the new rules to your immune system, during your format reviews and educational calls, when submitting your daily data (via email), implementing your **Dietary Progression**™.  

From your day one foods through your diagnostically formulated challenge lists, magical food moments begin to happen. You're introduced to multiple concepts that, clients agree, are eye opening experiences - windows of opportunity in learning how to tap-into your your body's own sleep technology, such as *Mapping Out Your Cleaning Cycles*™ and what's been dubbed, your *Horizontal Time - the Horizontal Position*™. a.k.a. REST. learning about *The PM Scale Reading*™, your prostaglandins hormone technology.

Most importantly, what all this means, from the correct foods that prove compatible to specific cells in need of rest, repair and other cells that are ready to go to work for you.  The timing of the correct foods within your Dietary Progression is everything. 

Nutrition's best kept secret - Is In Your Blood.


#Timing is Everything

When foods are eaten, they become chemical structures. If they become the wrong chemical structure for the food group they belong to, certain white blood cell membranes become irritated and inflamed, then become toxic dead weight and die.

The Cells interpret this as an attack within your system and contributes to your weight gain and toxicity by suppressing your immune system, the inflammation felt and seen on body parts, as if you were physically carrying around a dumbbell all day and night. You actually are carrying around this toxic dead weight, just in a different molecular form.

Different white blood cells help support the function of many specific systems in your body. Through the application we developed dietary progressions, we can tell which end system appears to be trending toward dysfunction and how your body will try to correct and repair with the foods that are in your particular program. Timing is everything with the right foods being eaten at the right time with the right amount of Horizontal Time, *HT*™.

When it’s the correct food for your system, this equals (=) the right energy for your system.

The wrong foods equal (=) the wrong energy. 

Our nervous systems and digestive systems neurology are truly marinated within our anatomy as an infused communication highway immediately interacting with the food we eat. *Internal phone calls-neurological communication with enzymatic conversation* start to activate with just the touch of food to your tongue, in preparation of coding the compatibility of your challenge food, working correctly or not working correctly. According to the "New Rules", protocols and application of your "Dietary Playbook's Dietary Progression". This is understood when in counsel specific to your particular system. 

**Serious Food For Thought**

Detecting which prostaglandin pathways are exhausted and in need of rest and repair is another one of our pioneering efforts. Understanding which prostaglandin foods, if possible, to start your dietary progression program with and which prostaglandin food not to start with can be a basic fundamental reason for your dietary success. 

Weight related or Immune related.

Timing this prostaglandin fundamental leads your bodies ability to manufacture more anti-inflammatory hormones (male or female) thus providing enhanced protection, efficiency, and performance for each end organ system involved.
This accomplished at any age is a WIN - WIN ! 


# IMMUNE RELATED

Many health problems are weight related and immune related. Any decrease in inflammatory processes will limit those unknowns that contribute to abnormal organ and cell function. As a special note, we would like mention that one of the program's applications is to improve immune response and cellular communication. In addition to weight management, an additional purpose of the  dietary program's protocol is to educate, motivate, and inspire participants on finding foods that will fulfill the essential fatty acid prostaglandin pathways with the correct fats for their systems.  This will enable their bodies to manufacture more anti-inflammatory hormones thus providing enhanced protection for each end organ system involved.  Many professional athletes and executives experience less injury, faster recovery if injured and more rapid recovery from exercise.

When it’s the correct food for your system, this equals (=) the right energy for your system.

The wrong foods equal (=) the wrong energy. 

Your body will have the opportunity to manufacture more anti-inflammatory hormones when you eat the correct fats for your system, allowing efficient and effective prostaglandin function which can cause the positive side-effect experience of less pain after exercise, as the professional athletes who have practiced our protocols have found. 

Many NFL, major-league baseball, and PGA-LPGA clients, elite executives, and working parents report that they do not feel the the need to take anti-inflammatory medication anymore after games and tournaments because their bodies supply more of their own anti-inflammatory hormones. This is also the reason that arthritic pain is relieved on this program. Other associated inflammatory issues gain relief and healthier management on this program. With coordinated guidance, many clients have reduced their doses of prescribed medications.


# Going Off Program & Going Back On Program
## Recovery Day Protocol 


When it comes to going off program for one meal, which we call a “Food-Lotto”™ or one day entirely, maybe a holiday, or a few days like a weekend getaway,  or longer, like a vacation, you will know exactly which foods are specific recovery day foods, when returning to your program and for your particular system. This becomes self-empowering and "CELL- Empowering. By trusting and knowing which foods to start back on program with, this accelerates the scale in the right direction, recovering within a 48 hour to 72 hour timeframe. Your system will be right back to where it was before you went off program, or very close to it.

The inflammation put on while off the program magically disappears and cannot be found on the scale, under the bed sheets, or at the gym because you didn't go. You chose to eat the right foods, get the right amount of horizontal time, in only the horizontal position and your system accelerated and incinerated the removal of inflammation that was put on when you went off program. All this accomplished with no exercise needed. Once you have witnessed this, as many professional athletes elite executives, parents, professional collegiate students stressed in school, and our beauty pageant participants have, all are guilty of shaving the hours off sleep not allowing specific organs to do what's medically necessary night to night to recover from being vertical all day and then over training in their fitness routines as that's becoming a trend.  

Now you're seriously inspired to go to the gym after your recovery day protocol, be on the right foods and witness your cleaning cycles capture an all time new low weight and body fat percentage, and you haven't even gone to the gym yet. 

Imagine going to the gym with all that already accomplished before you get there.

You'll be lighter, have more energy, more stamina, and a stronger mental focus because your body has recovered by eating the right foods, producing more energy in your fitness routines and athletically feeling stronger. On this program, you will be going to exercise for the “right” reasons and enjoy freedom from the “control the scale syndrome”.   

Female Systems have two options each month when their menstrual cycle is about to begin.

Option #1,  is to go off program and enjoy yourself in case you are having cravings because of hormonal Neuro-transmission.  Witnessing these patterns for over 28 years during this time of hormonal neural transmission almost all female systems state they experience weight gain, feel and see increased levels of inflammation in their body, even some moodiness. We teach our female clients to take advantage of this time, enjoy it or 

Option #2, Keep your system *food - focused*™ on achieving more efficiency and a level of hormonal correction.  Remain on program to have your cells become more efficient during your menstrual cycle, which can result in less hemorrhage, less fatigue, and more energy, both mentally and physically.  When option 2 is practiced within back to back months, more consistency between menstrual cycles is reported and timing of ovulation and menstrual cycle is improved.  A profound experience by some is regaining a menstrual cycle that has disappeared and others come to our dietary program seeking to increase their chances of pregnancy naturally, by attempting to regain their menstrual cycle by eating the right prostaglandin foods for their individual system.

Regardless if the female system chooses option one or option two, it becomes fun if you know the rules to play the game. Truly enjoy this time because either way you know which foods will help you recover and get you right back to where you were before. If you choose to stay on your foods, as a result your menstrual cycle ended early and the positive side effect is you have an all-time new low weight, or close to it.

Remember if you vacation on weekends or weeks at a time, it is very easy to come back on program where you left off and find continued success. I do suggest you enjoy yourself on vacations, holidays, weekends, or a day off, or you're just going to perform a food lotto until all the foods that work for you are what she would eat on vacation anyway. Yes, many clients enjoy Haagen Dazs & different variations of Organic ice cream from dairy, coconut, and many other choices in the marketplace as part of their program, with unlimited portions daily with great dietary success.



# (An Interactive Experience)

It’s at this time when on you're “Unique” individualized Dietary Progression, that your system is seeking compatibility through immune system parameters, rules, and protocols we share with you in counsel. It's the integration of your dietary progression that connects the diagnostic foundation formulated for you. As you receive your "Dietary Playbook" and start with the initial orientation call, “Titled – How To Play The Game”, to your individual format reviews using an interactive downloadable app spreadsheet day to day, and educational calls specific to your diagnostic section in your “Dietary Playbook" mapping out your dietary progression to remain food-focused and stay on program. Dr. Leon will be your guide.
 
Start to have an interactive experience on the right foods with your body. Most importantly understand it; your body's feedback, your Immunogenic Response! From food to food in which your immune system interacts and communicates with you, revealing your unknowns, delayed reaction patterns (if any), *Mapping Out Your Cleaning Cycles*, inflammation related to our (Scale Reactivity System™) and building your specific list of foods that *Proof Compatible* to white blood cells that have accepted the working relationship between the food structure and that specific white blood cells end-organ function, specific to that food and you. 

Like building a financial portfolio specific to your profession and lifestyle, these foods can be trusted, again, and again and again. Your “super-foods” your *secret-foods*™ discovered, specific to only your system, formulating your very own *Dietary Portfolio*. Your own nutritional science.

#We Use This Analogy:

If you only use the diagnostic findings without the application then...

Imagine you put a client (remember to think about that clients individual immune system, medical history, etc..everyone’s is different) in a room full of mosquitos, and you label the mosquitoes that are going to bite this particular client with the names of the foods that other testing suggests are not good at the time these other tests were performed, then remove these labeled mosquitoes from the room.

This is where most forms of testing, allergy testing and different sensitivity tests, results stop. 

It's at this point where our dietary software begins. The Dietary Program is the Dietary Progression that integrates/connects the diagnostic foundation we formulated for you.

Returning to this client in that same room that still contains other mosquitoes, we know from experience that some of the remaining mosquitoes will bite and some will not. By going through the dietary progression you will be able to determine which other mosquitoes will bite and then you can remove them from the room also. The client will still be in a room full of mosquitos, but those remaining will not bite. If you do not go through the Dietary Progression, real improvement will not occur due to the fact that you will always have that “other” interference from foods that were not identified problematic because of their unknown mechanism, but are still being eaten by the client. Unknown mechanisms of inflammatory reactions can start to occur, suppressing all parts of our immune system / bodily systems, or delayed reactions are experienced with 48-hours window of time.  According to protocols of our program, there will be a number of ways to have your system build immunity; antibodies to these chemical bites, (bites from food structures -that is) while you can remove them from the room also.  The client will still be in a room Full of mosquitoes, it's at this point again where our dietary software identifies more unknowns, the Dietary Progression parameters, the protocols, and the “New Rules” (The Dietary program) is what integrates, and connects your diagnostic foundation to the system we formulated for you.  

This is where we need more than just preliminary laboratory processing. We need more then just allergy tests and sensitivity tests. This is where we need more than just even our own dietary software we have pioneered and developed, yet it's the most minuet detailed starting place that we are aware of globally for the individual immune system. 

This is where we need to have a system of interpretation.  ( The Dietary Progression - Program ) is where your dietary progressions integrated nutritional program for applied immunology reveals the "unknowns" as you progress on your dietary program. Initial science could not and may not ever be able to detect, for many various reasons, internal and external environmental related issues in immune systems. The constant changes that are being allowed in experimentation to our foods (GMO’s) without having a thorough understanding of short-term or long-term effects on human beings, the labeling laws, and our ever-changing agricultural marketplace, domestically and internationally.

If you do not go through the dietary progression, real improvement will not occur due to the fact that you will always have other interference from foods that were not identified as problematic, whether determined through the diagnostic formulations or because of their "unknown mechanism", but are still being eaten by the client.
 
For over 35 years, our research based and developed integrated dietary software by SariMellman P.H.D. that is applied after initial laboratory processing, reveals during the formulation process more of your unknowns and 
an in-depth understanding to ones immune system not typically seen within many types of laboratory panel ordering,  food sensitivity testing, and different forms of allergy testing.
 
This is where the starting point of your medical interview, the drawn sample blood, the initial laboratory processing, and then the final staging of your specimen for Dr. Leon Mellman to diagnostically formulate your Dietary Progression.

This is the basic, fundamental underlying reason of Why We Are “ Unique”!,  We offer an integrated nutritional program for applied immunology you can learn and you can apply as long as you like...
