#Dr Leon's Story

At the age of three years old Leon Mellman was a thriving young boy. The wind beneath my wings as a first-time mom.  Leon brought so much excitement, 
happiness and magic into my life, my mother's life, Marianne Danziger, and my husband and father Milton Derek Mellman.

Leon was the reason I wanted to have more children, even considering what your about to read. Leon was no doubt a serious ball of energy. His first three years,  mentally growing, physically growing and we had just started him in a Montessori program where he tested out to be in the accelerated program. What parent would not be happy being told that. In my story,  at this time who would've known that within just the next six months I would face a tragic life changing event that our entire family would endure which put us on this path and embraced the journey traveled.  Guiding me thru more of my own self-discovery while pioneering this integrated nutritional program for applied immunology.  If it was not for Leon at the time having severe food reactions to that Apple juice and the other ingredients within it. Which we now know was the fundamental cause of his cognitive behavioral change. From hyperactivity to extreme fatigue, the Apple and apple juice suppressing his immune system and constantly bringing on respiratory infections.  What happened with Leon was the origin of inspiration, the motivating factor for the development of this Dietary program. At the same time, myself being constantly run down as a professional student at the University Miami, and working two jobs. We were at home as a family reflecting on Leon's day-to-day changes with his health and how they we're so inconsistent and unpredictable.  Medical professionals had no clear idea or understanding why this was happening with Leon, then.  Gathered in our living room with the TV on, a gentleman by the name of Jack Lalanne, comes on television with his wife. Jack is a nutritionist, a chiropractor and a natural bodybuilder.  He grabbed our attention, he was selling his first product, blue-green algae, this was interesting to me because I was constantly run down, my mother was constantly run down and now Leon with his health.  I purchased it, we started taking it as a group and we all felt better, symptoms went away and it was obvious our immune systems were improving.

This was remarkable and a pivotal time right before my accident when I experienced a higher calling, a sixth sense and made the change to pursue nutritional science as law school was just beginning.  Leon's symptoms were improving, no drastic attacks or behavioral energetic changes in weeks but then it happened.  We noticed that when Leon had apple and specific brands of Apple products with other ingredients on the label, not 100% apple and common at that time, Leon's immune system immediately reacted, like an asthmatic attack to producing excessive mucus and then always over the next two-days, what start resemble a cold or flu like symptoms and matured into strep throat symptoms with green and yellow mucus. Witnessing this pattern, we were able to identify brands of foods and the other ingredients.  The blue green algae supplement was no longer working for Leon's system, his system did not get stronger or correct this problem while staying away from the apple products and the other ingredients. Leon's system was being dominated by the food reaction from the apples and whatever the other ingredients were derived from.  At this time in the grocery store industry, we were suspect of many corn derivatives in children's products.   Looking back to see ahead, at this time we also did not have diagnostic capability to formulate a precise approach, an application, a Dietary Progression with foods that Leon's system would be compatible with and progress to what we now know are levels of dietary correction.    

During my recovery from the car accident I continued studies and once healed immediately finished my PhD and throughout this time working with Leon and different internships with medical centers that had interest in nutritional dietary practices,  leading to the development of our Dietary Progressions Program's software and the Dietary Progression application.

This is where Dr. Leon's Story takes off & his system makes the move to heal. Continuing through Leon's childhood constantly aware of what he was putting into his mouth and the way it effected his performance.  This developed a finely-tuned relationship of feed-back, what we call is the immunogenic response. As Leon matured, he understood and started to feel changes that were fast-acting.  His system proofing to be a fast-acting system and not throwing delayed reaction patterns. During Leon's adolescent years was the first generation of our software being developed and I was now practicing as a private nutritional counselor with our own applications we used our integrated form and understanding of nutritional immunology to help Leon battle colds any seasonal change most importantly his athletic and academic Drive. Leon at a young age was incredibly driven, just as he is today.  Myself,  husband & Leon's grandma found ourselves asking the question, where did this young boy come from, all his energy mentally and physically, his immune system was not going to let anything hold him back.   

It was almost like his immune system was constantly working to make up for time lost.  At the age of 13 when bar-mitzvahed, Leon was already 6 and a 1/2 feet tall, broad shoulders,  weighing between 178 to 185, his immune system was presenting like an adult.  At the age of 15,  people were constantly asking about Leon's muscle development.  Again it was like his immune system was making up for lost time and eating foods that were used correctly and more efficiently for his system had more time to thrive and tap into vitalistic energy. We continued our pioneering efforts, to figure this out and Leon's system reaching a level of correction. Where he could finally enjoy more food as a teenager but always aware of the foods being eaten and the ingredients.  Especially when it came time for academics and athletics, not wanting to experience a food reaction or push thru other symptoms when getting ready to perform.

Leon went to state championships in gymnastics then by the age of 15 he was also a 1stÂ° degree black belt in korean tae kwon do, he had been a part of a middle school basketball team that won county championships four years consecutively.  Attending South Broward's High School science magnet program with JROTC, Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps participation. Leon loved structure and function. Leon excelled through South Broward High School as one of the top athletes in Broward County receiving academic and athletic awards upon graduation and qualifying to apply for West Point Military Academy.  An honor. This required high level letters of recommendation from the a state governor and senator to military personnel. 1996 was the year of Leon's high school graduation at the same time the Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta Georgia. A junior Olympic committee contacted South Broward High School in selecting Leon and other Atheltes that academically and athletically excelled.  All so worthy of this honor to represent our country at the same-time be associated with the 1996 Summer Olympics Games, the timing couldn't have been better. We were so proud.

Leon's team of athletes were playing basketball in Belgium, Italy and Paris, in competition of similar age groups and some European professionals.  They won the bronze medal. 

This also gave Leon great exposure of what the next level would demand of him athletically.  Leon returned home and we now had great decisions to make from the buffet of options Leon worked so hard to receive from universities.  Possible Basketball scholarships, academic offerings, attending my all amateur University of Miami possibly, or his fathers, University of Cincinnati, to the West Point Military Academy option. We also had no idea that when returning home, Leon would be given the honor of, Escort Olympic Torch Bearer for Broward County.   Leon was paired with the other Olympic Torch carrier who lit the last remaining torch before it was carried to Atlanta Georgia for the final lighting of the Olympic Torch Ceremony by Muhammad Ali to start the 1996 Summer Olympics Games.  One week after this memorable event, I Sari Mellman would be hit by a drunk driver again and suffer a very serious cervical whiplash causing severe vertigo, not being able to function as a parent and not drive.

Right before this second accident happened, Leon had visited our family chiropractor who always played a very important role in our families healthcare. A specific type of chiropractic protocol was the sole reason for my overall recovery from the first accident mentioned in my story.  I remember Leon being so excited and anxious to go get his adjustment as soon as he returned home from that Olympic tournament tour. Every time Leon & I spoke when he was oversea's playing basketball he would anxiously express how his entire body needed an adjustment from the travel and the sports. From his neck, to his feet as athletically involved as Leon was, his understanding and awareness of food and the chiropractic care he got really helped him keep his pace, mentally and physically, there was no stopping him.

At this time our family would need Leon's extra strength.  Zev, Leon's younger brother was finishing middle school at the time and looking forward to attending the same high school.  

My third child Max was four years of age, at the time of this second accident. It was a blessing not disguised how Leon's role would influence the entire family in a positive way.

Leon's next step in life, making the decision to enroll into a dual bachelors of science in nutrition and Doctrit of Chiropractic program.  The first of its kind in the country & Leon being the youngest to ever attend this college, in Marietta Georgia, a suburb county on the outskirts of Atlanta.  Aspiring to become a University, Life College it was, and Life University to be.  

The Founder & President, Dr. Sid Williams on our first visit took a very special interest in Leon, as they both had JROTC, academics and competitive athletics in common.  Dr. Sid was fond of our strong association to chiropractic. They told me i may not walk again and I did because of the chiropractic care I received. Leon started college.  While back home in South Florida making my second recovery Leon was excited about the chiropractic clinic on the college campus using advanced techniques, the research center was getting great results, they could probably accelerate my healing. The timeline of events and Leon being embraced by Dr. Sid Williams contributed to Leon's development, adding to his background of certainty and confidence with what he already new of nutrition, his self - discovery and now the philosophy, science and art of being a Chiropractor. 

During Leon's clinical internship, multiple years of Ambassador awards were received, from Dr. Sid Williams.  Speaking at community events, practicing doctors offices and championing the University.  Dr. Sid Williams also awarded myself, an ambassador award for putting the trust, faith, and the belief where Leon was the youngest ever to attend LIFE.

Leon fulfilled the university's nutritional educational requirements by the year of 2000, and immediately started nutritional counsel hosting national calls.  In 2002, Leon became the first Doctor of Chiropractic, for both the Mellman and Danziger family generations. From this past-time to present time, Dr. Leon has received accolades ranging from Arnold Schwarzenegger's leadership affiliation to the International Sports and Fitness Council of America for pioneering efforts within the realm of professional sports.  As their sports chiropractic physician and nutritionist. The nutritional counsel of pro athletes. Continuing post graduate education acquiring diplomats and an additional board certification in complimentary fields of study to nutritional, integrated, and conventional energy sciences of medicine.

Zev who was significantly influenced by Leon's journey, is now the second Doctor of Chiropractic in our family. Dr.Leon and Dr.Zev practice together. I'm so proud.  It is a wonderful emotion, a magical moment to sit and watch people of all ages and children pour into the practice, feel the spirit and "B Your Greatest!"
