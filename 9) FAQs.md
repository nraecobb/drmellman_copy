FAQ: 

35 Years & Counting, not 2 programs ever the same.
Dr. Leon Mellman, my first son, to whom I pioneered this application & founded this program, in not accepting the diagnosis’s said at the time but knowing & being confident in what I witnessed his system at the young age of 4 years endure day to day was so consistent with foods at times and brands then so inconsistent with foods and brands at other times, that alone with a few other family events was the inspiration needed to create our nutritional science in dietary software and the application of a dietary progression.  
The diagnostic formulation is the starting point, your foundation,
 to build your very own dietary portfolio.

If wondering why your having food reactions, delayed symptoms, asking your self, or guessing at which food you think made you gassy today, mucousy, changed your bowls, sucked your energy mentally & physically like a vampire, your becoming frustrated or at that point with all the ingredients on labels that things are just not clear, you have been disciplined in eating clean, maybe even chemical free or have attempted different nutritional theories, practices or protocols or you have just a few foods that you or someone else has limited you to without scientific data or your following a practiced theory that provides too large of a list of foods to create something from yet find its not specific enough for you and you remain suspect of immune related issues that do not make any sense.

If any of the above is your experience or none of it and you desire another level of greatness in your life then we may be the right program for you.  My mother Sari Mellman dedicated her life's work to developing this program originally for saving my life and helping others.

I'm honored for your attention and time in visiting our website and learning who we are as an organization.  I look forward to your next step in pursuit of dietary excellence.

This is why we are different, We have an Integrated Nutritional Program for Applied Immunology.
