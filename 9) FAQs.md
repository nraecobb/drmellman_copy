FAQ:

Referrals, Recognition and Reward Program:  The "R3P" Internal Program 

This program allows for internal credits, with a real dollar amount, to be electronically stored in our system to recognize and reward you for your referrals.

One referral is valued at 500.00 internal credit points/dollars amount per referral.

This is electronically recorded as an internal credit that can be used towards your future Re-Engineering Diagnostic Dietary Formulation - Dietary Progression Program in 2016. 
If you are referring family members and wish to apply your internal "R3P" credits each of their individual program, the fee can be reduced by 500.00 up to 1,000 credit points/dollars maximum per individual.

If remaining credits are still pending, they will rollover to your next Dietary Re-Engineered application or you can apply it to the next person of your choice, per referral credit.

The active dietary client can also choose to "Award" their referral, a future new client, that is "not" a family member with their "R3P" internal credit points/dollars. 
The program fee can be reduced by 500.00 up to 1,000 credit points/dollars maximum, per individual.

FAQ: 

35 Years and counting, not 2 programs ever the same.

I pioneered this application and founded this program for my first son, Dr. Leon Mellman, because I did not accept the diagnoses at that time. I was confident that what I had witnessed his system endure day to day, at the young age of 3, was so consistent with foods and brands at times and then so inconsistent with foods and brands at other times. That, combined with a few other family events, was the inspiration I needed to create our nutritional science in dietary software and the application of a dietary progression.   

The diagnostic formulation is the starting point, your foundation, to building your very own dietary portfolio.

Maybe you're having food reactions or delayed symptoms and you're asking yourself (or guessing) which food you think made you gassy, mucousy, changed your bowls, or drained your energy mentally and physically like a vampire. You're becoming frustrated with all the ingredients on labels that are just not clear. Perhaps you have been disciplined in eating clean and/or chemical free or have attempted different nutritional theories, practices, or protocols. Maybe you have just a few foods that you, or someone else, has limited you to without scientific data or have been following a practiced theory that provides too large of a list of foods to create something from yet find it's not specific enough for you and you remain suspicious of immune related issues that do not make any sense.

If any of the above is your experience or you desire another level of greatness in your life, we may be the right program for you. I have dedicated my life's work to developing this program to save my son's life and help others.

We're honored for your attention and time in visiting our website and learning who we are as an organization. We look forward to your next step in pursuit of dietary excellence.

This is why we are different. We have an Integrated Nutritional Program for Applied Immunology.
