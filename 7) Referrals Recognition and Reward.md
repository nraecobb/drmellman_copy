# Referrals, Recognition & Reward Program:  The "R3P" Internal Program 

This program allows for internal credit points, with a real dollar amount, to be electronically stored in our system to recognize and reward you for referrals.

One referral is valued at **$500.00** internal credit points/dollars amount.

This is electronically recorded as an internal credit that can be used towards your future Re-Engineering Diagnostic Dietary Formulation - Dietary Progression Program in 2016. 

If you are referring family members and wish to apply your internal "R3P" credits to each of their individual programs, the fee can be reduced by **$500.00**, up to 1,000 credit points/dollars maximum, per individual.

If remaining credits are still pending, they will roll-over to your next Dietary Re-Engineered application or you can apply them to the next person of your choice, per referral credit.

The active dietary client can also choose to award their referral (a new client that is not a family member) with their "R3P" internal credit points/dollars. 

The program fee can be reduced by **$500.00** up to 1,000 credit points / dollars maximum, per individual.

Reducing the cost of the Dietary Progression Program.

These credits are not applied to business groups or during email and Holiday Campaigns. Confidential credits with business groups of six or more participants can be discussed.


### Tax - Incentives | Flex Spending - Healthcare Savings Accounts:

Business and group referrals offer possible tax incentive strategies to the responsible entity or individual(s). Questions regarding the Dietary Programs fee or Oxygen Chamber packages for purchase/lease/rental can be discussed during your interview with Dr. Leon Mellman.
