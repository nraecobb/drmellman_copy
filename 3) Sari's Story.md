#Sari’s Story

Have you ever imagined that you would be hit by a drunk driver running a red light and, as a result, not walk for four years? 

Now imagine, at the same time, your 3 year old son starts to experience drastic food reactions, causing aggressive respiratory distress, asthma like symptoms, chronic re-occurring upper respiratory infections (being rushed to the hospital a few times), incredible mental and physical cognitive swings, from extreme fatigue to hyperactivity, all changing day to day.

That was the experience that turned Sari Mellman away from law school and toward nutrition. During rehabilitation from that accident, an alternative educational program was being offered from Bachelor of Science in Nutrition to a PhD in the Science of Nutrition.

Coupled with her Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Miami, this opportunity appeared interesting and, more importantly, possible.

After her unexpected recovery, she was licensed by the State of Florida Board of Medicine as a Nutrition Counselor and introduced herself to the community and found employment with a variety of medical centers and then a research laboratory. 

Soon after she was employed by the laboratory, they were busy attempting to automate food allergy testing with blood serums, rather than traditional skin testing, and then validate their results with double-blind studies.

Being involved with this process made Sari realize that there were results obtained that would not be beneficial to the marketing of their findings because many test subjects were provoked by foods not found by their instrumentation. 

When she brought these results to their attention, they were ignored and she was instructed to tell those subjects that they were not having food reactions. 

When Sari inquired exactly what those subjects were experiencing, she was told the reactions were unknowns. It wasn't long at all when she realized that there were many more unknowns than knowns. 

Sari was given freedom to apply the results and which foods were not uncovered by their testing to formulate dietary programs for the participants. Leon Mellman, Sari’s son and inspiration, was one of those participants from the very beginning.

She began to see patterns and consistent weight loss when making specific adjustments to the patterns she uncovered.

When Sari wanted to share her findings, she was told that it was not important because they had to validate the instrumentation to sell tests and that she should go home and be a mother. 

What a slap in the face! They did not appreciate and value the reality she was showing them or that together they could change peoples lives for the better.

Sari Mellman felt that she was being shown a truth as equally important. People, Leon inculded, were becoming well; their systems healing. As time went on, it did not matter that the lab, scientists, and doctors were not listening. 

People were listening and they still are, eighteen years later! 

Now, 35 years later, people are still listening to Sari’s son, Dr. Leon Mellman.
