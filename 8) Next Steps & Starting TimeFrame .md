### Your Medical Interview
Appreciate what makes your system unique and different.

During your medical interview, you and Dr. Leon Mellman will "Define Your MAIN FOCUS".  

Dr. Leon will listen carefully to you and speak with you regarding what your healthcare journey has endured. He will learn and strategize your professional and personal environments, lifestyle management, medical history, sleep habits, any food beliefs developed and any equipment you may use at home to recover from flight/travel, and in-home wellness strategies practiced that may influence your soon-to-be magical food moments, all in the PURSUIT of DIETARY EXCELLENCE. 
 
Please confirm your address and the form in which you chose to apply your initial deposit or complete payment. If you have already completed this, or are in the process at the QuickStart Option on the contact and billing information page, thank you. The initial deposit will expedite the specimen kit shipping to the address you indicated on the contact information, if different from the address on your I.D. Only complete, upfront payments expedite the processing of your program's diagnostic formulation, which will reflect on the invoice emailed following your interview.

Dr. Leon will answer any questions you may have during your medical interview.
